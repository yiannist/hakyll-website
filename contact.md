The prefered way of contacting me is to mail me at:

   > gtsiour -(at)- softlab -(dot)- ntua -(dot)- gr

If you need it, grab my [Public PGP Key](files/yiannis_t.asc). (Note: my [old
key](files/old.asc) has been revoked!)

You can try to catch me on IRC -- I lurk as `yiannis_t` in the `#foss.ntua`
and `#gnu` channels on [GrIrcNet](http://www.irc.gr/) and the `#xmonad` and
`#haskell` channels on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/).

Also, you can follow me on [Identi.ca](http://identi.ca/yiannist) (or if you
insist on using non-free alternatives:
[Twitter-mirror](http://twitter.com/#!/tsi0u_)).

For urgent matters, send a postcard to

   > Software Engineering Laboratory
   > School of Electrical and Computer Engineering
   > National Technical University of Athens
   > 15780 Zografou, Athens, Greece

I like postcards! : )
