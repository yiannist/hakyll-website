The prefered way of contacting me is to e-mail me at:

If you need it, grab my public [PGP Key](files/gtsiour-0x5C06E89C8DB264BB.pub).
I like encrypted e-mails! I have created a new, stronger
[OpenPGP key](files/gtsiour-0x2D2A7A23591DFFB1.pub) (4096R) and will be
transitioning away from my old key soon. You can find my signed
([sig1](files/sig1.txt), [sig2](files/sig2.txt)) transition statement
[here](files/transition_statement.txt). If you have signed my old key, I would
appreciate signatures on my new key as well!

You can try to catch me on IRC -- I lurk as `yiannis_t` in the `#foss.ntua`
channel on [Freenode](https://www.freenode.net/) and occasionally in `#xmonad`,
`#haskell`, `#erlang` or `#haskell-distributed`.

I don't use [Skype](https://stallman.org/skype.html) but I do use Jabber! My
XMPP id is: yiannist@jabber.org.

Facebook (and social networks in general!), you won't find me there.
