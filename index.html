      My name is Yiannis Tsiouris, and I am a senior student at the
      <a href="http://www.ece.ntua.gr">Electrical and Computer
	Engineering</a> Department of
      the <a href="http://www.ntua.gr/index_en.html">National 
	Technical University of Athens</a>. I was born in 1988, and I' m
      currently residing in Athens, Greece.

      It has been a while since I 've been thinking of creating my
      spot in the web, and here it is! I 'd like to
      thank <a href="http://jaspervdj.be">Jasper Van der Jeugt</a> 
      for giving me the 'kick in the butt' by
      offering <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll">Hakyll</a> to the world.
