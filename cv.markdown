This is a work in progress.

My objective is to conduct research and pursue a Ph.D. in Programming
Languages Theory and Implementation. 

Currently, me and my colleague, Chris Stavrakakis, are working on
implementing a Low Level Virtual Machine [LLVM](http://www.llvm.org "LLVM") 
backend for Erlang, under the supervision of Associate Professor [Kostis
 Sagonas](http://user.it.uu.se/~kostis "kostis"), as a part of our diploma 
thesis.


# Education

* Secondary School: 4th Lyceum of Larissa (GPA: 19.4/20).
* National Technical University of Athens: Diploma of Electrical and
  Computer Engineering, specialization in Computer Science (Expected
  GPA: 8.73/10.00)  (*in progress*).


# Projects


During my studies at School of Electrical and Computer Engineering in
NTUA I have implemented many projects (on my own or in collaboration
with some colleages) as part of various lessons. 

Some of the most interesting ones (projects i enjoyed the most :) are
listed below: 

* Implementation of a Compiler for Tony, a Python-like language (with
  semantics of call-by-reference, dynamically allocated types and
  garbage collection) in OCaml. Part of Compilers lesson. Source and
  language specification: [[source](/files/compiler.tar.gz "Tonyc")] 

* Implementation of the [Hindley-Milner
  Algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference "Type Inference")
  for simply typed Î»-calculus in Haskell. Part of Programming Languages II
  lesson. [[source](/files/typeinf.tar.gz "Type Infererence")]

* Efficient implementation of the [Travelling Salesman Problem
  (TSP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem "TSP") 
  O(n^2^2^n^) algorithm in C. [[source](/files/tsp.tar.gz "TSP source")]

* Implementation of Database Management System (DBMS) in Python, Qt4
  and PostgreSQL. Part of Database Systems lesson. [[source](/files/pydbms.tar.gz 
  "Pydbms")] (*Greek*)

* A device driver for a virtual character serial device for the Linux Kernel. 
  The driver is implemented as a kernel module. Part of Operating Systems 
  Laboratory lesson. [[source](/files/lunix.tar.gz "Lunix")] and
   [[report](/files/lunix.pdf "Report")] (*Greek*)

* Design and implementation of an infrastructure to mark processeses that do
  not need files they own to be cached in memory. In that way, processes that 
  need to 
  be re-executed won't "stall" waiting for their files to be cached-in again 
  (because they were forced to swap-out by other "marked" processed). The
  infrastructure is called "Curse" and is implemented as a kernel patch for 
  2.6.37 Linux Kernel. Part of Operating Systems Laboratory Lesson. [design](/files/curse-design.pdf "Design"), 
  [source](/files/curse.tar.gz "Curse"), [report](/files/curse-report.pdf
  "Report") (*Greek*)
