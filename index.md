My name is Yiannis Tsiouris, and I am a Ph.D. student in the [School of Electrical
and Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.ntua.gr "ECE") at the [National
Technical University of Athens](http://www.ntua.gr/index_en.html "Ntua"). I was
born in 1988, and I' m currently residing in Athens, Greece.

It has been a while since I 've been thinking of creating my spot in the web,
and here it is! I 'd like to thank [Jasper Van der Jeugt](http://jaspervdj.be
"Jasper") for giving me the 'kick in the butt' by offering
[Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll "Hakyll") to the world.
